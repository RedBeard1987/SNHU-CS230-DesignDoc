Gaming Room Design Doc

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  -The Gaming Room is the client. They want to create a game called "Draw It or Lose It". The game is currently only available on Android devices. The Gaming Room wants to expand their game to a web-based version that is accessible for multiple platforms. The software requirements are as follows:
  
  -A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
  -Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
  -Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
  -Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  -The document created remained neat and organized for professional insight. Listing client and server side recommendations and tools used to integrate programs and apps on cross platforms.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  -There was a lot of research and different platforms to explore how they worked and operated. This got me to understand better the operations and working of different platforms used not only for software developments but the basic understanding of OS systems as a whole.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  -The client and server side recommendations and tools used. I would expand upon my recommendations and emphasize more tools that could be better suited for cross platform integration. I would expand upon the cost of licenses and different tool expenses to assist the developers and stake holders in the decision making process on the direction that would be best for integrating a cross platform design.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  -I used the singleton Pattern to ensure the game had one and only one instance of a game. I also used iterators in the coding to ensure that every existing team or player was looked at to ensure there wasn't any duplicate teams or players. Its always important to follow a clients design needs as it can play a key role in functionality of the game or program. If modified in a way outside of the clients needs the program may crash or just have an unsatisfied client which could lead to future clients not wanting to work with your company. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  -By fully understanding the clients needs and wants of the software project allowed me to develope the code and create a design document to benefit the client. In the future I would consider the budget of the client to ensure cost effectiveness. I would also make sure every method I was recommending was easily understood as to why it was being recommend and ensure all purposes were well known. Keeping the clients best interest at heart will make the client happy, it will ensure satisfaction and create a positive repor with that client and may lead to future clients by recommendation or word of mouth.
